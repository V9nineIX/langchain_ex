# Retrieval-based QA System with Embeddings using langchain

This is the code used from my YouTube Video: "Get Started with LangChain in Node.js in 10 Minutes": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxx1KUWJFv4

This is an example code for running a retrieval-based question answering (QA) system with embeddings using the `langchain` library. The code demonstrates how to create and utilize a vector store to retrieve answers to questions from a given text file.
